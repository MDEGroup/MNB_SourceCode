# EASE 2020 Replication package


This repository contains the replication package and dataset of the paper to be published at EASE 2020 with the title **A Multinomial Na√Øve Bayesian (MNB) network to
automatically recommend topics for GitHub repositories**

All the resources, including the tool, the dataset, and the article have been realized by:

- Claudio Di Sipio 
- Riccardo Rubei
- Davide Di Ruscio
- Phuong T. Nguyen


# Setting the environment 

To run the Python scripts, you need the following libraries:

- scikit-learn 0.22.1
- nltk 3.4.5
- guesslang 0.9.3
- tensorflow 1.6.0 (required by guesslang)
- PyGithub 1.44

Notice that guesslang module requires Python 3.6. More information about this module can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/guesslang/)

# Crawler settings

To enable the crawler, you have to set a personal access token in this way:

access_token = Github ("your token", per_page=100)

To generate an access token from your Github profile, please refer the following [link](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)

The optional parameter per_page is useful to paginate the results

# Run the tool 

In main.py, you have to edit the following paths:

- train_dir = "path_to_train_folder"
- test_dir = "path_to_test_folder"


After the train data is loaded, you have to modify the following parameters in the predict_topics function: 

- dirs: the root folder that contains the test files
- test_dir: the test folder for a single round
- train_dir: the train folder for a single round
- labels: the list of topics to predict
- num_topics: number of predicted topics
- list_test: a txt file that contains the name of repository to test

The output is a CSV files with all the metrics presented in the work:
- success rate (1..5)
- precision
- recall
- top rank
